# BookmarksSorter

It's a wannabe (not yet approved) extension for Firefox and hopefully for Chrome; lets you sort bookmarks, including subfolders.
In this first version it does not include a graphical interface for management; once installed every time a bookmark is added, changed or moved all bookmarks are sorted alphabetically lower case.

## Future developments

- Publish the extension ðŸ˜…
- Add more sorting criteria
- Insert a graphical interface to manage the type of sorting
- Allow to choose between automatic and manual sorting
- Allow excluding folders from sorting
